There are many advantages to using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby.

1. You can treat objects and methods as nouns and verbs, allowing for code functionality that is easier to understand.
2. You can more easily group behaviors together through namespacing, inheritance, and so on.
3. You have access to a wider variety of variables, such as instance and class variables, that can make creating a program and adding functionality a more seamless process.
4. Grouping behaviors together means less repetitive code.
5. The code becomes a lot more flexible, allowing easier management of the program.
