The `@@cats_count` is a class variable that is accessible throughout all instances of the class `Cat`. The variable is originally initialized on line 2 to reference the integer `0`, then, with every instantiation of the class, the value will increment by `1`, as seen on line 7. Lastly, the `cats_count` class method is defined on line 10, which outputs the value of `@@cats_count`.

We can showcase this operation by instantiating 2 `Cat` objects and output the return of `Cat.cats_count` after each instantiation.

```ruby
class Cat
  @@cats_count = 0

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
    @@cats_count += 1
  end

  def self.cats_count
    @@cats_count
  end
end

p Cat.cats_count

Cat.new('black')
p Cat.cats_count

Cat.new('orange')
p Cat.cats_count
```
