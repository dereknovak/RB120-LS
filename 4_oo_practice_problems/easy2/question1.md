Line 2 will return `"You will <something>"`, with `<something>` being a random string returned from the array within the `choices` instance method. On line 3, the `choices` instance method is invoked, which returns the array on line 7. The `sample` method is then called on this array, returning a random element from it, which is then concatenated onto the string `"You will "`. Because the `predict_the_future` method is called on the `oracle` object, the concatentated string is returned.
