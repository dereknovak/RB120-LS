Calling the `predict_the_future` method on `trip` will return the string `"You will <some trip>"`, where `<some trip>` refers to a randomly chosen string from the array on line 13. While `predict_the_future` is used from the `Oracle` class due to inheritance, the `choices` instance method within the `RoadTrip` class overwrites the one in `Oracle`, as the `trip` object is from the `RoadTrip` class. When a class has the same instance method name as one in its superclass, it will prioritize the one in the subclass.
