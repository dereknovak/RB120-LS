To simplify the class, you can add an `attr_accessor` to the top of the class and pass in `:type` as an argument. This automatically creates both getter and setter methods for the `@type` instance variable.

It's also worth mentioning that `@type` on line 15 can be changed to `type`, which allows for clearer readability.
