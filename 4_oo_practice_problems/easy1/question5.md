Of the two classes, only `Pizza` will create an instance variable upon instantiation, that being `@name`. This is due to the `initialize` constructor method implemented into both. For `Pizza`, a `name` gets passed as an argument to the instantiation, of which the value is assigned to `@name`. On the contrary, when `Fruit` is instantiated, the value of `name` is assigned to a *local variable* called `name`. This is an important distinction, as the instance variable is accessible throughout the entire object, while the local variable is only scoped at the `initialize` method.
