In order to include the behaviors of the `Speed` module, you can mix it into each class by calling the `include` method and passing `Speed` in as an argument to each class. This will allow both classes use of the `go_fast` method.

```ruby
module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  include Speed
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end

class Truck
  include Speed
  def go_very_slow
    puts "I am a heavy truck and like going very slow."
  end
end
```

To check whether the mixin was successful, simply call the `go_fast` method on an instance of each class.

```ruby
Car.new.go_fast
Truck.new.go_fast
```
