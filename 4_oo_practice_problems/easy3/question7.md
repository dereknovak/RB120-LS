Practically everything in this example is obsolute, as the string included in the `information` class method does not use any interpolation for the `@color` and `@brightness` states. Along with that, the attribute methods declared on line 2 are not used within the method and, even if the string had interpolated the methods into it, would be inaccessible due to it being a class method.

Lastly, the explicit `return` on line 10 is not needed, as the string exists on the last line of the method definition and would be returned from it, anyways.
