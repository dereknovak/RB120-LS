      * Spock    - Rock, Scissors

    - If a winning challenger is chosen, the player wins the round.
    - If a losing challenger is chosen, the computer wins the round.
    - If the player and computer choose the same challenger, it's a tie. The round is repeated.
    - After a player wins the majority of the total rounds, they are declared the "GRAND CHAMPION".
