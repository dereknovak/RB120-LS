  Before play:

    - Set up the total number of rounds. To ensure a winner each game, the total rounds
    must be odd.

      Total Rounds     - 5
      Winning outcomes - 3, 0
                         3, 1
                         3, 2

  Gameplay:

    - Each round, the players select a challenger to compete. Every challenger has 2 others that it will win against.

      * Rock     - Scissors, Lizard                   
      * Paper    - Rock, Spock                   
      * Scissors - Paper, Lizard                   
      * Lizard   - Paper, Spock                   
      * Spock    - Rock, Scissors

    - If a winning challenger is chosen, the player wins the round.
    - If a losing challenger is chosen, the computer wins the round.
    - If the player and computer choose the same challenger, it's a tie. The round is repeated.
    - After a player wins the majority of the total rounds, they are declared the "GRAND CHAMPION".
